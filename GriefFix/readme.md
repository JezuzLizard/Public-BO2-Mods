## Team Balancing:

Picks a team for a player on join based on how many players are on each team

CIA/Inmates are the default team if teams are equal

## Game Start Delay and Quota:

Adjustable wait time

Adjustable quota

Either the wait time and quota can be fully disabled by changing the value of 1 variable each

## Randomized Game Settings:

Can be turned off by disabling the corresponding variables

**defaults:**

50% chance of disabling quick revive

30% chance of diabling jugg

20% chance of first room only

30% chance of hyper speed spawns (max move speed, max spawnrate, no walkers, 1 second between rounds)

15% chance of 4x max drops per round

10% chance of box moving disabled

50% chance of max zombies set to 32

40% chance of deadlier emps (4x duration)

20% chance of deflation (points only earned from kills)

20% chance of shorter rounds

40% chance of electric doors being disabled

## Map Restart:

After intermission the map restarts using map_restart instead of a normal restart

This fixes the no sound bug on respawn

But requires all other players except 1 player to be killed and respawned

Player downs are reset after players respawn

## Map Rotate

The map can rotate between 3 locations 

Town, Farm and Bus Depot //requires one of these maps to be loaded initially and only works on tranzit

## Requirements
Grief requires gts teamCount "2" to work properly in the server config turn it off when loading non-grief maps

## Better waiting hud
An addon for better waiting hud on grief to enable this copy the lines and replace line 243 - 246 on main.gsc

### Changelog
//Players are set to spectator state directly instead of being killed
Reverted to killing players on Grief only

InitialMapRestart() replaced with give_team_characters
